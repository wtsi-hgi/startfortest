# Change Log
## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Switched to using native iRODS controllers, executables and helpers (no longer requires `test-with-irods`).
- Groups predefined controllers by product (e.g. iRODS) not by type (e.g. service).
- Allows quicker testing with latest versions of controllers only.
- Rebranded from `startfortest` to `useintest`.

## 1.0.0
### Added
- First stable release
